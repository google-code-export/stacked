= Lawsuit update =

Due to a Temporary Precautionary Measure verdict court of first instance we have to remove Ra-Ajax while the lawsuit proceeds. Therefore, we have removed the download options and source-code for Stacked in addition to Ra-Ajax.

In addition, we will not sell, market or publish Ra-Ajax from this day forward until this lawsuit is settled.

We hope that this will just be a minor hick up, and we believe that we'll get to publish Ra-Ajax again when this lawsuit is finished. First, we will appeal this temporary verdict to the court of second instance.
